# E_Commerce_backend

Project Description:-
This project contains the backend structure of fully functional E-Commerce Website built in Python with Django and MongoDB as the database. 
I am using django-mongoengine package to make the connection smooth and facilitate better efficiency and functionality while working with MongoDB.
Basic Django structure has been followed to keep the code clean and understandable.

How to run the code:-
Go into the project root directory
Install all the packages with the help of requirements.txt
Run "python manage.py runserver". 

P.S. The packages used might be out of date as I have not updated the project for a while.
